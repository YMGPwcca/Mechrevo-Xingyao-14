# BIOS and firmware structure

## Research baseline

The investigated machine was reported to have moved from BIOS 1.09 to BIOS 1.15. The retained firmware display values were:

```text
BIOS Version: 1.15
EC Version:   1.15
Build Date:   05/07/2026
```

The build-date string is preserved without assuming a date convention. Internal EC strings use separate build namespaces; the reported `EC Version: 1.15` and any internal EC build label are not silently merged. The reported update changed the boot graphics and introduced an animation. This is a baseline observation, not a complete vendor release history. Sources: [S1 and S9](research-sources.md#project-sources).

## BIOS package structure

The baseline report identifies the outer archive as `STX_SKU2_1.15.zip`, containing `STX_SKU2_1.15.exe`. The outer ZIP was not available for rehashing. The uploaded EXE was independently inspected as a 7-Zip self-extracting archive, with the embedded 7-Zip signature at EXE file offset `0x3946F`.

```text
STX_SKU2_1.15.zip                 reported outer archive
  STX_SKU2_1.15.exe              independently inspected SFX
    isflash.bin
    H2OFFT-Wx64.exe
    platform.ini
    H2OFFT64.sys
    BiosImageProcx64.dll
    InterToolx64.efi
    H2OFFT.inf
    FlsHook.exe
    supporting runtime libraries
```

`isflash.bin` is 35,626,768 bytes. It is not the same artifact as the 33,554,432-byte raw ROM. Offsets in these two representations are not interchangeable.

The inspected 1.15 updater has SHA-256 `11718b7f48a13ca08f627c1c3103cf4d1a3ee6857e15bcb165210c11e0ec446a`; the nested image has SHA-256 `4dd5ebb5fb5f23b0de8df0cbd60d6453cfe1f5a22f69ef34ceb24432d80094c1`. Complete file identities are recorded in the [artifact registry](research-artifacts.md). These are offline artifact measurements, not evidence that the updater was executed.

### Completion configuration

The inspected configuration contains the following values, with the OEM inline comment omitted from this excerpt:

```ini
[FlashComplete]
Action=1,1
Dialog=0
Counter=15
ActionOverride=0
```

The adjacent configuration comments define action value one as Shutdown and two as Reboot. This is configuration evidence; no updater was executed during consolidation.

## H2OFFT identity and embedded help

The 1.15 package's `H2OFFT-Wx64.exe` has SHA-256 `86f336d74c2ab951d04f35143c5efaabce94a4ebe9dd87fd62b018ad7103adb0` and size 3,004,280 bytes. Its PE string resources report `FileVersion=6.73` and `ProductVersion=6.73`; its fixed numeric file-version tuple is `6.7.3.0`. These representations are recorded separately.

The executable's retained help strings include:

```text
-g                Read current ROM and save to file.
-iv               Show utility and onboard BIOS supported IHISI
                   version.
-pq               Query BIOS protection region MAP in current ROM.
```

Static presence of these options does not prove successful execution against a particular firmware. Exact live IHISI versions, a complete `-pq` region map and a fully retained acquisition transcript remain pending source recovery. A PE version resource is not evidence of the previously proposed build date. See the consolidated gates in [documentation status](documentation-status.md#pending-evidence).

## Raw-ROM reference

The baseline investigation recorded:

```text
Artifact: P916F-STX-current-ROM.bin
Size:     0x2000000 bytes / 33,554,432 bytes / 32 MiB
SHA-256:  77043505b6f42e4a482110a7ba0c7e12ba6b1db28fdaed2743c28578bbf76cd7
```

This is the reference parent for the baseline raw-ROM EC carve and raw-ROM FDM offsets. Its bytes were not available for a new whole-image verification during consolidation. The earlier claim that a raw-ROM DXE slice matched an updater slice byte for byte is not promoted to a verified comparison without the source ranges and comparison output.

## EC extraction representations

| Representation | Parent address space | Start | Length | Evidence |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| Preferred baseline EC image | Raw ROM | `0x081000` | `0x20000` | Retained analysis report and digest |
| Earlier updater EC extraction | Nested `isflash.bin` | `0x268E30` | `0x18000` | Independently repeated extraction; digest matched |

The different lengths are significant. The 98,304-byte updater carve must not silently replace the 128 KiB image used for the baseline banked-EC analysis. The [EC reference](embedded-controller.md) specifies the code and XRAM landmarks associated with the latter.

## Boot graphics

The baseline analysis records an animated GIF associated with `OemBadgingSupportDxe`:

| Property | Recorded value |
|---|---|
| Resource GUID | `931F77D1-10FE-48BF-AB72-773D389E3FAA` |
| Dimensions | 800 × 600 |
| Frames | 60 |
| Duration | Approximately 1.74 seconds |
| Related module | BootGraphicsResourceTableDxe |
| Related module GUID | `B8E62775-BB0A-43F0-A843-5BE8B14F8CCD` |

The Linux BGRT capture reported `status=0`, `type=0`, `version=1`, `xoffset=1040` and `yoffset=387`. The horizontal relationship `1040 + 800 + 1040 = 2880` is consistent with the recorded panel width. It is a geometric correlation, not an image replacement interface or proof of runtime animation timing.

The [boot-logo investigation](boot-logo-research.md) documents the two examined update mechanisms and their limitations. An exact extracted-GIF digest, byte size and decompressed-image offsets remain pending source recovery (**P11 = NEEDS_EVIDENCE**); the proposed values in the private lead register are not promoted here.

## SetupUtility and HII formsets

The recorded SetupUtility FFS GUID is `FE3542FE-C1D3-4EF8-657C-8048606FF670`. The Boot formset GUID is `2D068309-12AC-45AB-9600-9187513CCDD8`.

The retained option audit identifies separate Power, Advanced, Main, Boot, Security and Exit formsets, plus AMD PBS and AMD CBS HII formsets. The latter are not automatically ordinary children of the OEM Advanced menu. Form reachability, suppression and the recovered option inventory are documented in [BIOS setup options](bios-setup-options.md). The page reports the eight option rows actually present in the excerpt separately from the source-reported PBS 204 and CBS 416 totals; P01 remains `NEEDS_SOURCE_EXPORT`.

### Quiet Boot

```text
QuestionId:       0x1064
VarStore:         SystemConfig
VarStore GUID:    A04A27F4-DF00-4D42-B552-39511302113D
VarStore offset:  0x6E
Disabled:         0x00
Enabled:          0x01
```

The baseline live read was reported as `Setup[0x6E] = 0x01`. The source's runtime variable label and IFR VarStore name are retained distinctly; a complete variable-export record is required before generalizing variable-name aliases. This observation establishes the read value, not the result of changing it. Other proposed setup live overlays remain pending (**P12 = NEEDS_EVIDENCE**).

### Dynamic LID

The audit identifies `Dynamic LID` / `AmdDynamicLid` at `AMD_PBS_SETUP+0xDF`, with an IFR default of zero. Its runtime effect has not been established. The ACPI lid-state path is a separate fact and does not establish open-lid power-on behavior.

## Runtime visibility and permanent modification

The baseline report records a successful SREP runtime reveal of the suppressed Boot page. A separate permanent SetupUtility suppression candidate was noted near extracted-PE file offset `0x2636A0`, with a proposed `0x46` to `0x47` change. That permanent modification was not flashed or live-tested.

These are different experiments. A retained candidate configuration is not automatically the one used by the successful session. [Runtime setup visibility](srep-runtime-reveal.md) records the available evidence without publishing an unverified patch recipe. The exact successful SREP build, configuration association, photograph and digest remain pending P13.

## Logo paths and firmware access

The [boot-logo investigation](boot-logo-research.md) keeps the Type-0x54 callback and Type-0x6D provisioning checks separate. The Type-0x54 callback rejects the examined raw-logo request; the Type-0x6D target GUID was absent from the recorded ESRT and 47-entry raw-ROM FDM result. These bounded results do not establish that every OEM-specific logo mechanism is impossible.

The retained PSP sysfs observation reports ROM Armor enforced. The available evidence does not justify a complete map of permitted flash operations or a universal claim about Linux dumping support. See [firmware access](firmware-access.md), which consolidates acquisition, PSP and region-map source gates rather than presenting proposed diagnostics as a live transcript.

## Firmware portability boundary

`P916F-HPT-R` and `P916F-ARL` are related names encountered during research, not validated compatible firmware targets. Board power sequencing, EC firmware, GPIO assignments, flash layout and setup defaults must be established separately before any cross-platform inference.
