# Battery-limit state after battery-depletion power loss

## Scope

This page records a live persistence observation from the investigated MECHREVO Xingyao 14 / `P916F-STX`. The capture was supplied after the machine had fully lost system power because the battery was depleted. The capture does not restate the BIOS or firmware-reported EC revision, so this page does not independently attach a firmware-version identity beyond the investigated unit and the battery-limit interface shown in the output.

The observation supplements the earlier validation in which `Enabled=1`, `T1=80%`, `T2=100%` survived a normal reboot. It establishes a different outcome after this later battery-depletion power-loss event.

This page is specifically about **persistence**. The later 85/90 experiment separately resolves the live behavioral roles of T1 and T2; see [battery threshold semantics](battery-threshold-semantics.md). The fact that the fields were later observed as `0/0/0` after depletion does not alter those threshold semantics.

## Raw capture

```text
=== P916F-STX Battery Limit ===
Enabled : 0 (OFF)
T1      : 0% (0x00)
T2      : 0% (0x00)

=== Current battery state ===
AC online: 1
SOC      : 89
Status   : Charging
Power    : 21137000
Energy   : 64350000
Voltage  : 13431000
```

The battery telemetry units follow the Linux power-supply conventions already used by this repository: `Power` is recorded in µW, `Energy` in µWh and `Voltage` in µV. The capture therefore corresponds to 21.137 W reported battery charging power, 64.350 Wh reported stored energy and 13.431 V reported battery voltage at that instant.

## Established result

The previously configured battery-limit state was not present after the recorded battery-depletion power-loss event. The next observed state was:

```text
Enabled = 0
T1      = 0
T2      = 0
```

At the same time, AC was online, SOC was 89%, and the battery reported `Charging`. This is **Live-confirmed** evidence that the earlier `1 / 80 / 100` configuration did not survive this recorded complete-loss-of-system-power event.

The earlier normal-reboot result remains valid and distinct:

```text
normal reboot -> state 1 / T1 80 / T2 100 retained
battery-depletion full-power-loss event -> state 0 / T1 0 / T2 0 observed afterward
```

## Boundaries

This observation establishes behavior, not the persistence mechanism. It does not determine when the values were cleared or whether clearing occurred during battery depletion, an EC brownout/reset, firmware initialization on the next power-on, or another transition associated with the event.

It also does not establish that every G3 transition, battery disconnect, CMOS/RTC-power removal, explicit EC reset, firmware update, or other power-loss class produces the same result. No claim is made that the threshold fields are necessarily stored only in volatile SRAM.

The observation is complete-system-power-loss evidence, not direct instrumentation of the EC power rail. Therefore it does not by itself prove a specific complete-EC-power-domain-loss mechanism.

Operationally, the result means the charge-limit state must not be assumed to remain enabled after a battery-depletion event that fully powers the machine off. A state readback is required before relying on the limit after such an event. A persistent Linux implementation should restore the desired policy only when readback shows that state has been cleared or changed; see [battery charge-limit protocol](battery-charge-limit.md#persistence).
