# Live validation report

This report preserves recorded P916F-STX EC and battery experiments. Historical baseline experiments are registered as [S1](research-sources.md#project-sources); the later battery-depletion reset capture is [S18](research-sources.md#project-sources); and the 85/90 threshold-semantics experiment is [S19](research-sources.md#project-sources). The behavioral counterpart to this report is [battery-charge-limit.md](battery-charge-limit.md), with the isolated three-region interpretation in [battery-threshold-semantics.md](battery-threshold-semantics.md).

Historical output is preserved verbatim where quoted. Threshold labels such as `F2 80` and `F3 100` use decimal threshold values: the corresponding wire data bytes are `0x50` and `0x64`. Linux battery units in the retained captures are `capacity` in percent, `voltage_now` in µV, `power_now` in µW and `energy_now` in µWh. Blank output is not interpreted as zero.

## 1. Live ITE Super-I/O identity

Observed configuration-space result:

```text
CFG 0x2E: chip=0xFFFF rev=0xFF
CFG 0x4E: chip=0x5571 rev=0x07
```

The valid identity response was obtained at I/O `0x4E`.

### PMC2 logical device

Logical device `0x12` returned:

```text
PMC2 active = 0x01
I/O #0      = 0x0068
I/O #1      = 0x006C
I/O #2      = 0x0000
IRQ         = 0x00
```

The working transport was therefore:

```text
PMC2 DATA            = 0x68
PMC2 COMMAND/STATUS  = 0x6C
```

The discovery was performed independently of the EC disassembly and subsequently correlated with the working command path.

## 2. Rejected candidate I2EC path

A candidate dedicated I2EC interface at base `0x380` was evaluated by querying state rather than writing threshold fields:

```text
I2EC control : EC[200D] = 0xFF
Battery %    : EC[0394] = 255
Threshold #1 : EC[0D13] = 255
Threshold #2 : EC[0D14] = 255
MMIO crosschk : FEEC2394 = 92
Cross-check   : MISMATCH
```

The known shared-memory SOC address simultaneously returned:

```text
0xFEEC2394 = 92
```

The candidate path was therefore rejected for the tested configuration.

## 3. PMC transaction behavior

The successful transactions used:

```text
status bit0 = OBF
status bit1 = IBF
```

The host waited for `IBF=0`, wrote the command byte to command/status I/O `0x6C`, waited again, and wrote the subcommand/data byte to data I/O `0x68`. When a response was expected, it waited for `OBF=1` and read `0x68`.

Commands were derived from static firmware analysis before the experiments. No brute-force command scan is part of this validation record. Bounded timeouts, stale-output handling, concurrent ownership and the complete error contract remain unestablished.

## 4. Initial charge-limit state

Before any setter was exercised in the baseline experiment:

```text
F1 12 enabled/state : 0x00 (0)
F1 13 threshold #1 : 0x00 (0%)
F1 14 threshold #2 : 0x00 (0%)
```

Baseline state:

```text
state = 0
T1    = 0
T2    = 0
```

The getter sequence returned coherent disabled/default values before mutation.

## 5. Threshold write/readback while disabled

The original transaction labels were:

```text
F2 80
F3 100
```

These labels mean T1=80 decimal and T2=100 decimal; their data bytes are `0x50` and `0x64`.

```text
Before: enabled=0
F2 80 response  : 80
F3 100 response : 100
After: enabled  = 0
0D13            = 80%
0D14            = 100%
```

This established that:

- `0xF2` reaches threshold field `XRAM[0x0D13]`;
- `0xF3` reaches threshold field `XRAM[0x0D14]`;
- getters read the written values back coherently;
- threshold programming does not implicitly enable the subsystem;
- the tested SET transactions returned response bytes corresponding to accepted values.

## 6. Enable transition

Recorded operation:

```text
F1 11
```

Observed state transition:

```text
Before enable: state=0, T1=80%, T2=100%
Sending F1 11 (ENABLE)...
After enable : state=1, T1=80%, T2=100%
```

The specified operation is `0xF1 0x11`. This is live confirmation of enable behavior while preserving the programmed threshold values.

## 7. Original 80/100 charge-stop behavior

The battery was approximately 89%. The adapter was physically disconnected for the first part of the trace and connected during the sequence. Initial `Discharging` samples therefore do not test AC-connected limiting.

```text
00s  status=Discharging  cap= 89% power_now=3906000 voltage_now=13003000
02s  status=Discharging  cap= 89% power_now=4609000 voltage_now=12984000
04s  status=Discharging  cap= 89% power_now=3648000 voltage_now=13002000
06s  status=Discharging  cap= 89% power_now=3612000 voltage_now=13003000
08s  status=Discharging  cap= 89% power_now=3953000 voltage_now=13000000
10s  status=Discharging  cap= 89% power_now=3601000 voltage_now=13004000
12s  status=Discharging  cap= 89% power_now=4140000 voltage_now=12999000
14s  status=Discharging  cap= 89% power_now=4140000 voltage_now=12999000
16s  status=Charging     cap= 89% power_now=2263000 voltage_now=13052000
18s  status=Discharging  cap= 89% power_now=246000  voltage_now=13053000
20s  status=Not charging cap= 89% power_now=0       voltage_now=13054000
22s  status=Not charging cap= 89% power_now=0       voltage_now=13054000
24s  status=Discharging  cap= 89% power_now=903000  voltage_now=13042000
26s  status=Not charging cap= 89% power_now=0       voltage_now=13054000
28s  status=Not charging cap= 89% power_now=0       voltage_now=13054000
```

The repeated settled observation was:

```text
SOC well above 80%
AC connected
status = Not charging
power_now = 0
```

After intentional discharge below the boundary, the recorded observation with AC connected was:

```text
displayed 77–78% -> charging continued
around displayed 79% / slightly above -> charging stopped
```

Representative capped sample:

```text
79% - Not charging
```

This established the practical T1 boundary for the 80/100 policy but did not isolate the role of T2 because a normal battery does not reach `SOC > 100`.

## 8. AC-online capped snapshot

```text
=== BATTERY ===
capacity:   79%
status:     Not charging
power_now:  0
energy_now: 63154000
charge_now:
voltage:    12764000

=== AC ===
ACAD: online=1
```

The snapshot establishes AC presence, `Not charging`, and reported battery `power_now=0` at that instant. It does not measure wall-side adapter power or every instantaneous battery current.

## 9. Normal-reboot persistence

After a normal Linux reboot without reapplying the configuration:

```text
state = 1
T1    = 80
T2    = 100
```

Recorded conclusion:

```text
configuration persists across a normal reboot
```

This is evidence for normal-reboot persistence only.

## 10. Battery-depletion full-power-loss observation

A later observation was recorded after the machine had fully lost system power because the battery was depleted. On the next powered session, the battery-limit query and current battery telemetry returned:

```text
=== P916F-STX Battery Limit ===
Enabled : 0 (OFF)
T1      : 0% (0x00)
T2      : 0% (0x00)

=== Current battery state ===
AC online: 1
SOC      : 89
Status   : Charging
Power    : 21137000
Energy   : 64350000
Voltage  : 13431000
```

The earlier `1 / 80 / 100` values were therefore not present after this recorded depletion event. This is **Live-confirmed** clearing for that event.

The capture cannot establish when or why clearing occurred. It does not distinguish depletion/brownout from an EC reset, firmware initialization on the next power-on, or another event-associated transition. It also does not establish behavior for every G3 transition, physical battery disconnect, CMOS/RTC-power removal, explicit EC reset, firmware update or other reset class.

The operational consequence is bounded: after battery depletion causes complete system power loss, the charge-limit state must not be assumed to remain programmed. See [battery-limit-power-loss-observation.md](battery-limit-power-loss-observation.md).

## 11. Earlier high-load battery-energy test

A separate baseline experiment applied approximately five minutes of all-CPU load while AC was connected.

### Before load

```text
20:47:14  cap=79%  status=Not charging  power=0  energy=63154000
```

### CPU stress execution

```text
stress-ng: info:  [21163] setting to a 5 mins run per stressor
stress-ng: info:  [21163] dispatching hogs: 20 cpu
stress-ng: info:  [21163] skipped: 0
stress-ng: info:  [21163] passed: 20: cpu (20)
stress-ng: info:  [21163] failed: 0
stress-ng: info:  [21163] metrics untrustworthy: 0
stress-ng: info:  [21163] successful run completed in 5 mins
```

### After load

```text
20:52:27  cap=78%  status=Charging  power=28128000  energy=62661000
```

The reported stored-energy decrease was:

```text
63.154 Wh -> 62.661 Wh
Delta     = 0.493 Wh
```

Calculation: `(63154000 - 62661000) µWh = 493000 µWh = 0.493 Wh`. The timestamped snapshots span 313 seconds, while the stress tool reports a 300-second configured run. These intervals are not interchangeable for precise average-power calculation.

This result supports net battery-energy contribution during the observation and is consistent with battery-assist behavior. It did not isolate T2 and is therefore distinct from the later 85/90 active-discharge experiment.

## 12. 85/90 programming and readback

To isolate both threshold semantics, the subsystem was later programmed as:

```text
Enabled = 1
T1      = 85%
T2      = 90%
```

The numeric wire data were:

```text
85 decimal = 0x55
90 decimal = 0x5A

T1: command 0xF2, data 0x55
T2: command 0xF3, data 0x5A
```

Immediate readback confirmed:

```text
Enabled : 1
T1      : 85% (0x55)
T2      : 90% (0x5A)
```

The policy therefore had three reachable regions before the behavioral trace was interpreted:

```text
SOC < 85%       candidate charge region
85%..90%        candidate hold region
SOC > 90%       candidate T2-specific region
```

## 13. T1 live validation

### Charging below T1

At displayed 82%, AC was initially disconnected:

```text
AC=0
SOC=82%
status=Discharging
```

When AC was connected at the same displayed SOC, the battery entered high-power charging:

```text
12:30:38  AC=1  SOC=82%  status=Charging  power=37852000
12:30:43  AC=1  SOC=82%  status=Charging  power=43811000
12:30:48  AC=1  SOC=82%  status=Charging  power=43752000
...
12:31:38  AC=1  SOC=83%  status=Charging
...
12:32:43  AC=1  SOC=84%  status=Charging
```

This directly establishes charging below T1 for the tested policy.

### Charge-stop transition near T1

The decisive transition occurred while Linux still displayed 84%:

```text
12:33:08  AC=1  SOC=84%  status=Charging      power=42486000
12:33:13  AC=1  SOC=84%  status=Discharging   power=23000
12:33:18  AC=1  SOC=84%  status=Not charging  power=0
12:33:23  AC=1  SOC=84%  status=Not charging  power=0
```

The subsequent state remained near displayed 84%, predominantly `Not charging`, with reported energy approximately stable.

The ~23 mW transient `Discharging` sample is not equivalent to the later multi-watt T2 active-discharge state.

T1 was programmed to 85% while Linux displayed 84% around the transition. This does not invalidate the threshold. The Linux `capacity` value and EC decision input are different sampled observations and are not established to update synchronously. The earlier T1=80 experiment likewise stopped near displayed 79–80%.

Supported conclusion:

```text
T1 = lower charge/hold boundary
Linux integer capacity = approximate external indication of that boundary
```

## 14. T2 live validation: active discharge above T2

The battery was charged above T2 and the validated 85/90 state was restored while AC remained online.

At the beginning of the recorded trace:

```text
14:56:53  AC=1  SOC=94%  status=Discharging  power=8867000  energy=68116000
14:56:58  AC=1  SOC=94%  status=Discharging  power=9055000  energy=68104000
14:57:03  AC=1  SOC=94%  status=Discharging  power=8234000  energy=68092000
...
```

The behavior continued through 93%, 92% and 91%. Representative 91% samples were:

```text
15:08:09  AC=1  SOC=91%  status=Discharging  power=20879000
15:08:14  AC=1  SOC=91%  status=Discharging  power=21982000
...
15:09:55  AC=1  SOC=91%  status=Discharging  power=7906000
...
15:11:35  AC=1  SOC=91%  status=Discharging  power=10674000
```

AC remained online while reported battery energy decreased. This is direct live evidence of net battery discharge above T2.

Supported conclusion:

```text
SOC > T2
    -> active battery discharge with AC online
```

## 15. T2 boundary release

High-power discharge continued during part of the interval while Linux displayed exactly 90%:

```text
15:11:40  SOC=90%  Discharging  15.788 W
15:11:45  SOC=90%  Discharging  20.515 W
15:12:00  SOC=90%  Discharging  25.383 W
15:12:10  SOC=90%  Discharging  31.166 W
15:12:30  SOC=90%  Discharging  30.005 W
```

Discharge power then fell sharply:

```text
15:12:40  SOC=90%  Discharging  0.304 W
15:12:45  SOC=90%  Discharging  0.340 W
15:12:50  SOC=90%  Discharging  0.457 W
...
15:14:55  SOC=90%  Discharging  0.046 W
```

Finally the battery entered a stable hold state:

```text
15:15:50  AC=1  SOC=90%  status=Not charging  power=0
15:15:55  AC=1  SOC=90%  status=Not charging  power=0
```

It then remained predominantly at:

```text
AC=1
SOC=90%
status=Not charging
power_now=0
energy_now=64972000
```

This establishes release of the sustained active-discharge state as the battery returns to the T2 boundary region. The Linux-visible 90% value during the transition does not identify the exact internal EC comparator instant.

## 16. Energy evidence for forced discharge

The T2 trace began near:

```text
14:56:53
energy_now = 68.116 Wh
```

By the stable T2 hold region:

```text
energy_now = 64.972 Wh
```

The reported decrease was:

```text
68.116 Wh - 64.972 Wh = 3.144 Wh
```

across approximately 18 minutes 57 seconds. Using those endpoints gives an approximate average net battery contribution of roughly 9.95 W.

This average is not presented as a calibrated electrical measurement: workload varied, `energy_now` is quantized and no wall-side adapter power was recorded. The qualitative conclusion is much stronger than the exact average: the battery lost several watt-hours of stored energy while AC remained continuously online. Therefore the T2 state is not merely `charging disabled`; it is genuine battery discharge.

## 17. Combined behavioral model

The live evidence now supports:

```text
SOC < T1
    -> Charging

T1 <= SOC <= T2
    -> Hold
    -> Not charging
    -> no intentionally sustained multi-watt discharge observed

SOC > T2
    -> Active discharge
    -> AC remains online
    -> battery supplies net stored energy
    -> SOC is driven back toward the T2 region
```

The 85/90 experiment directly demonstrated all three regions.

The earlier 80/100 behavior is now explained by the fact that `SOC > 100` is effectively unreachable during normal operation. With T2=100, the active-discharge region is effectively excluded, leaving T1 as the practical charge-cap boundary.

This explanation does not validate every arbitrary `T1=N,T2=100` configuration.

## 18. Static charger correlation

The high-level T2 behavior no longer depends on a charger-model inference because it has been independently observed live. Static reverse engineering nevertheless provides a lower-level correlation: the secondary branch modifies bit 5 of charger register `0x12`.

That register contract is compatible with a TI BQ25700A/BQ25710-family `EN_LEARN`-like discharge-oriented function. Exact charger silicon identity has not been established.

Evidence separation:

```text
T2 active-discharge behavior
    -> Live-confirmed

exact charger family / EN_LEARN register naming
    -> static-supported family-level inference
```

## 19. Validation boundaries

The following statements remain unestablished:

```text
all valid T1/T2 pairs behave identically
T1=N,T2=100 always creates an N% cap
behavior when T1 == T2
live behavior when T1 > T2
exact fractional/internal SOC at each comparator transition
exact Linux-visible percentage at the comparator instant
exact hysteresis width beyond the observed policy regions
exact charger IC and electrical mechanism of active discharge
every G3/battery-disconnect/EC-reset class clears the state identically
power_now=0 proves the adapter supplies every instantaneous system watt
```

The disable/reset path `0xF1 0x10` remains static-confirmed only. The post-depletion `0/0/0` state does not prove that this handler executed or that the fields are necessarily stored only in volatile SRAM.

The behavioral meaning of T2 is no longer unresolved: the 85/90 experiment live-confirms it as the upper boundary of the active-discharge region on the investigated P916F-STX.
